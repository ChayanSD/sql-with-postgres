--Day 2 ---

Let's say you have large amount of data in a file like person.sql.
How to import this file in Postgres ? 
    \i <file_path> <file_name>
 Example : \i /user/chayan/person.sql

 --How to sort data ---
 SELECT * FROM <table_name> ORDER BY ASC;
 Code in chapter2 sort_data.sql

--Day 3 ------

Where cluse : 

Where clause used to filter the data with some condition.
-- Remember the person.sql file whre we have a gender filed , Now i want to see List of perople whre their gender is female.

SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <field_name> = <value>;
SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female';

Comparison Operator 
--We can perform arithmatic operation 

SELECT 1 = 1; 
-- t
SELECT 1 <> 2

--> <> means not equal 
< , > , <= , >= 

------Chapter 4 -----------
LIMIT : let's say , I need first 10 people from my table ; 
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;

OFFSET : what offset does? Now i want to see 10 people from id 10 to 20 ;

SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10;

-------Chapter 5 ---------

LIKE 
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%google.com';

SELECT BY
